# Pok√©mon Battle Planner
This little project came to life because I got tired of relying on charts to figure out which Pok√©mon I should use in important battles. The idea is simple: search for a type to see which matchups work best, or search for a Pok√©mon and we‚Äôll pull up its stats for you. You can even add your current party, and we‚Äôll highlight your strongest and weakest options for that fight!

Just keep in mind, this tool has its limits. It doesn‚Äôt consider Pok√©mon levels or the opponent‚Äôs moves. Think of it as a helper, not a miracle worker.
