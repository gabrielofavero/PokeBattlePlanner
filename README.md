# Pokémon Battle Planner
This little project came to life because I got tired of relying on charts to figure out which Pokémon I should use in important battles. The idea is simple: search for a type to see which matchups work best, or search for a Pokémon and we’ll pull up its stats for you. You can even add your current party, and we’ll highlight your strongest and weakest options for that fight!

Just keep in mind, this tool has its limits. It doesn’t consider Pokémon levels or the opponent’s moves. Think of it as a helper, not a miracle worker.
